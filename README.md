# COIL-3D : A CAD Tool for the Optimisation of Inductive Links in 3D-ICs
COIL-3D is a CAD tool for determining best performing inductor geometries for use in Inductive Coupling Link (ICL) based Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D-ICs), developed at the University of Southampton, in collaboration with Arm Research.

The tool takes as its inputs a configuration file (*.cfg) describing the physical and electrical parameters required for the design and then generates an inductor layout to maximise the performance of the inductive channel, for data transmission at a given frequency.

COIL-3D consists of two main elements: 
* The solver: a set of mathematical expressions to compute the electrical characteristics of the link directly from its physical parameters (see below),

* The optimiser: the optimisation algorithm used to determine best-performing layouts

The tool also provides a gui viewer utility, to visualise the otpimization process and allows export of:
1. A SPICE netlist of the link
2. A DXF file containing the physical inductor geometry
3. A HFSS project file containing the generated inductor

Variants of COIL-3D have been presented at Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE) 2018, and more recently in IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, 27 (3).

## Usage
###Â Dependacnies 
The COIL-3D commandline parser uses the libconfig libarary and the COIL-3D viewer uses the 
sudo apt-get install libconfig-dev
apt-get install libcairo2-dev

### Compiling COIL-3D
The COIL-3D tool can be compiled using the makefile provided, by cloning the repositry and running make:
```
git clone https://github.com/bjf1g13/coil-3d.git
cd coil-3d; make
```
By default the COIL-3D tool also compiles a lightwight viewer utility to graphically show the optimisation process, which relies on X11.lib
